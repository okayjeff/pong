# PyPong
*PyPong* is a twist on the classic *Pong*. While it might 
look and feel familiar, the objective and mechanics are different.

## How to Play
This is a single-player game where you control the left 
paddle using the mouse. Your only objective is to continue
volleying the ball back to the computer player, who will 
never miss the ball. Each time you successfully return the
ball to the computer player, the speed of the ball increases
slightly.

All the while, a clock at the top of the screen is keeping
track of how long you're able to keep the ball in play. Your 
top five best records will be kept in a file called called
```records.txt``` in the game's root directory. In a later version,
I'll add these records to the Game Over screen.

My personal record is 35 seconds. Can you beat it?
